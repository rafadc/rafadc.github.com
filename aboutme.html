    <p>My name is Rafael de Castro. I live and develop software in Madrid, Spain. This
    is my little page where I drop some content from time to time. Mostly about software
    development but who knows. This is a personal page anyhow.</p>

    <p>I'm also the proud father of a little kid. She helps me a lot and with 1 year
    she writes better code than I do. Well maybe not... but she's really cute. </p>

    <p>You will often find me at <a href="http://mendicantuniversity.org/">Mendicant University</a> 
    participating in whichever event we may organize. The MU is a
    group of programmers that want to learn together and leave a positive impact on the
    world. If you don't know a lot about MU you should check its 
    <a href="https://github.com/mendicant/mendicantuniversity.org/wiki/Newcomer's-Guide-to-Mendicant">newcomers guide</a>
    and the <a href="https://github.com/mendicant/mendicantuniversity.org/wiki/Community-guidelines">
