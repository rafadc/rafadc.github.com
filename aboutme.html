<h2>About me</h2>
<img src="/images/me.jpg" class="float-right cast-shadow"/>
<p>My name is Rafael de Castro. I live and develop software in Madrid, Spain. This
is my little page where I drop some content from time to time. Mostly about software
development but who knows. This is a personal page anyhow.</p>

<p>I'm also the proud father of a little kid. She helps me a lot and with 1 year
she writes better code than I do. Well maybe not... but she's really cute. </p>

<p>You will often find me at <a href="http://mendicantuniversity.org/">Mendicant 
University</a> participating in whichever event we may organize. The MU is a
group of programmers that want to learn together and leave a positive impact on the
world. If you don't know a lot about MU you should check its <a href="https://github.com/mendicant/mendicantuniversity.org/wiki/Newcomer's-Guide-to-Mendicant">
newcomers guide</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/mendicant/mendicantuniversity.org/wiki/Community-guidelines">
community guidelines</a> to understand a little bit what it is.
