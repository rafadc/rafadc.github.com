    <p>My name is Rafael de Castro. I live and develop software in Madrid, Spain although
    I was born in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gij%C3%B3n">Gij√≥n</a>. This
    is my little page where I drop some content from time to time. Mostly about software
    development but who knows. This is a personal page anyhow.</p>

    <p>I'm also the proud father of two little kids. They help me a lot and with 1 year
    they really write better code than I do. Well maybe not... but they are really cute. </p>

    <p>I've been a coder since I can remember. Starting with an Amstrad CPC 6128 that my parents bought me
    coding small Basic programs until now... Software development is my passion and I try to do it just
    a little bit better each day. You can find some chops I made at <a href="http://github.com/rafadc">Github</a>.
    There is nothing too fancy there but, you know, it's my little space.</p>

		<p> Of course I'm always open to writing some code if you want to. In case you have reached this point
		you can always drop me a line to pair with me.<br /><br />
