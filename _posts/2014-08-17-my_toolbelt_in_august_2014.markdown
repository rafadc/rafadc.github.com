I have a decided to publish from time to time my current toolset. I'm
trying to honor my tools and spend some time polishing the tools I use
more often and I'll keel this blog posts as a place to keep some
random thoughts about this.

The tools I'm putting here are the list of tools I have no problem in
investing more time in learning how to get more of them since I use
them on a daily basis.

## Programming languages ##

- **Ruby**: Of course this is the number one in my list. Probably it is
now my weapon of choice when looking for results fast. Also I think it
is difficult to find a language where it is more fun to implement a
nice DSL.
- **Clojure**: The new kid in town. I'm not as proficient on this but I
feel very happy working on it and probably it is here to stay. Its
value for simplicity makes it a great weapon.
- **Javascript**: One can never forget about the ubiquitous web
language. Anyway, I'd like to replace it one day with Clojurescript.

## Editors ##

- **Emacs**: Yes. Finally it is at the top of the list. I'm using it for
almost anything. Once you go past the initial entry barrier you start
to appreciate its power. I'm finding still some problems here,
specially about the stability of some plugins but I'm mostly happy
with it.
- **Sublime Text**: I'm using it still. Specially when wandering through a
  code base where I'm not familiar with the code. I'm still more
  comfortable using the mouse there.

## Documentation ##

- **Dash**: Any serious programmer needs to use this. I'm starting to
  build some cheatsheets for it to have them at hand. Also it is
  priceless to be able to fully browse documentation while on the
  move.

## Operating system enhancements ##

- **Alfred**: I can't use a Mac without this. This is **the** tool for
  making your computer a blaze to use.
- **Divvy**: Even though there are some open source alternatives it has
  some minor things that make me stay with Divvy. For example, the
  ability to repeat a keyboard shortcut to move a window between
  monitors when I have one attached to my laptop ;)
- **iTerm2**: I couldn't find a terminal embedded in emacs that works half
  as good as our old iTerm2.
- **tmux**: And the ideal complement to iTerm. I disabled the tabs on
  iterm to only use tmux tabs. Also I have scripts that bootstrap my
  projects with the window arrangement I like the most using tmux. A
  real productivity tool.
- **zsh + oh-my-zsh**: My shell of choice. An awesome set of presets plus
  awesome code completion.

## Libraries ##

- **Sinatra**: For building solid, long term sustainable web applications
  and services.
- **Rails**: For scaffolding ideas
- **RSpec**: TDD's best friend

## Things I'm keeping an eye on ##

- **Xiki**: As a shell replacement. Looks promising but installing it
  is a bit messy. I'd love to see this in Homebrew.
- **Haskell**: As a strongly typed language I'm eager to put my hands
  into. I'd love to learn more about type category theory and such and
  this looks like an awesome framework to do so.
- **core.logic**: Another paradigm I'd love to learn a bit about.
