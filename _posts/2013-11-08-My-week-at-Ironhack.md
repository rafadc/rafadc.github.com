I had the immense luck of being a teacher this week on [Ironhack](http://www.ironhack.com). It
was the first time I was going to teach a group of people so I was scared to death. My job
was to teach some Ruby basics to a group of people with some experience on programming that
had no knowledge of Ruby at all. In just four days they managed to write their own unit tests,
do some TDD, apply SOLID principles and pair program a lot. 

I was thinking on writing a blog post before the course ended but I couldn't. Each day was more
intense that the previous one. Each day we wanted more than the day before. It was exhausting.
Anyway each day was more rewarding than the previous one.

The people there are __A-WE-SOME__. There are 12 amazing guys/girl in the class that pour
each drop of blood they have in order to learn as much as they can to reach the goal of building
amazing software. They were truly inspiring to me. They are smart, proactive and passionate. I'll
be back to work on Monday and I'll tell to the team I work with about the bunch of amazing 
people I met. 

I'm sure that these guys will make something remarkable and I'll be there to say: "I was there
while they were still starting".
