### The workshop

I drove a [small workshop](http://www.meetup.com/madswcraft/events/104049322/) about BDD for the Madrid Software Craftsmanship meetup. It was a great experience. I learned a lot in the process so I wanted to recap my experiences.

### The outcome

Basically it was horrible. I prepared a huge range of exercises and due to many reasons we could only do one that was not the most important one. 

### Lessons learnt

 - Exercises in a workshop must be self-contained. You should not rely on what you speak but what people sees in their screens. There were more people than expected in the workshop and I could not spend almost no time with each of them.
 - Let everybody go their own pace. Everyone deserves to have fun. A nice way of having all the people 100% involved is proposing a challenge of their level. If somebody needs less time to go through the simplest examples he should be able to do so to get to the more challenging ones.
 - Prepare less but prepare right. Conversation will arise. 
 - A coding workshop has no need for a presentation excepting maybe for some small introduction. You will spend a lot of time speaking to people and trying to solve problems they may have. Also, you can find time to ask questions to some of the groups in the workshop.

### Was everything horrible?

I suppose not. Some people approached me after the workshop and said that they learnt a lot.

Also, the discussion after the workshop was pretty interesting. The practical exercise was a cool excuse to start working about scenarios where all what we did before could be applied.

### Do I want to repeat?

After the traumatic experience... of course I do! Indeed it was a good experience. Also I see that I have a lot of room for improvement here and I want to walk that road.
