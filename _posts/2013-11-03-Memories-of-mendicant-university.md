This week I'll be teaching an introduction to Ruby at [Ironhack](http://ironhack.com/).
This brought some memories back to me...

For me it is being really hard even though this has not started yet. This is the first
time I act as an "official" teacher to a group of people so I want to make an impact
in the 4 days I'll be with them. 

This makes me remember the times when I started learning Ruby. I had the luck
of joining [Ruby mendicant university](http://mendicantuniversity.org/) while it was
still open. I can't express how grateful I am to 
[Tobias Pfeiffer](https://twitter.com/PragTob) for all the time he spent reviewing my
code and telling me that I had to stop writing Ruby code the same way I wrote Java.

Now, one year after the shut down of Mendicant University, I still feel identified with
their values and still try to honor the status of alumni of what once was an awesome
place to learn how to write awesome code.

I want to bring some of the values I acquired there to the Ironhack students. Passion,
honesty, humility... When I think of [Gregory Brown](https://practicingruby.com/), 
[Andrea Singh](https://twitter.com/madebydna) or [Jordan Byron](http://jordanbyron.com/)
I see the living examples of what I want to be to the guys at the course. If I can
change their lives half as these guys changed mine my mission will be accomplished.

Just wish me good luck. I'll try to honor the memories of the mendicant university.
